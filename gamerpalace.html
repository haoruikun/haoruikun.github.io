            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>There are many gamers who travel- they like to travel during the day, and want to play games during the night in hotels. </p>
            <p style="font-size: 30pt; font-weight: 500; text-align: center;">However, most hotels donâ€™t provide the gaming equipments gamers need. </p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption class="text-center">"It is very rare for general hotels to provide adequate gaming equipments."</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>I interviewed 5 gamers. I first asked them what do they want in the hotel for their next trip that could cater their gaming needs. Their answers varies a lot because they like to play different kinds of games. Some people want high performing computer, some want gaming consoles, and some want table and collections of board games. So I figure that we should <strong>provide different kinds of room catering different gaming needs.</strong> We can have different themes like PC themes, console themes, and board game themes. </p>
            <p>Then I move on to the app itself, I asked them what features do they want in the hotel app. I got a lot of feedback. Besides some common basic features like browsing and booking , many of my interviewees pointed out that they wanted some kind of <strong>chatting features that can enable them to chat with other gamers in the hotel so they can play games together.</strong> I decide to incorporate this feature in the app so our customers can have a good time and even build a gamer community that could be our loyal long-term customer group. </p>

            <h2>The Goals</h2>

                <li>Include a chatting function that allows gamers in the hotel to socialize.</li>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>User research is a powerful process. I started this project without the idea of incorperating chat features. Through user research, I learned what my users really want, and I was able to design the best product for them.</p>
            <p><strong>Next steps:</strong> Due to the time limit of this short design challenge, I was only able to do one round of research and created a basic layout of the app. The next steps would be doing more prototypes for more features and do rapid user testing and prototyping to improve the product.</p>
